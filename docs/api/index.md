```bash
ConsoleAppVisuals
├───Core.cs
├───Extensions.cs
├───Placement.cs
└───Position.cs
```

### Core.cs

This class is the core of the library. It contains the methods to display the different visuals and variables.

### Extensions.cs

This class contains different extensions methods for strings and tuples.

With Position.cs and Placement.cs, it belongs to the tools classes.

### Position.cs

This class is used to define any position defined by an X and Y coordinate. It may be used in cases like matrix selectors for example.

### Placement.cs

This class is used to define the placement of a text in the console. It may be useful to indicate where to place a text in a console, or to define the position of a text in a larger string.
